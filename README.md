# Least-Square-Linear-Classifier
Train a least-squares linear classifier on the 2D training data and test it on the training and test set. The data for this exercise are stored in the files
lc_train_data.dat, lc_train_label.dat, lc_test_data.dat and lc_test_label.dat


# apply.py:

This function loads the train and the test datasets. It first trains the linear classifier on the training data and then applies it on both the training and the test datasets. Analyze the classification plots for both the datasets.

- Train the classifier using the training dataset
- Evaluate the classifier on the training dataset
- Print and show the performance of the classifier
- Test the classifier on the test dataset
- Print and show the performance of the classifier
- Add outlier to training data
- Train the classifier using the training dataset
- Evaluate the classifier on the training dataset
- Print and show the performance of the classifier
- Test the classifier on the test dataset
- Print and show the performance of the classifier

# leastSquares.py :

The function that trains a least-squares classifier based on a data matrix data and its class label vector label. It provides as output the linear classifier weight vector weight and bias bias.
- Sum of squared error minimized

# linclass.py :

The function that classifies a data matrix data based on a trained linear classifier weight, bias.
- Linear Classifier
- Perform linear classification i.e. class prediction
- Discretize classes, make hard decision

# plot_.py

- PLOT_ Summary of this function goes here
- Define the range
- Plot the data points and the decision line
